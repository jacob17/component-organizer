# Getting Started with Component Organizer: a Figma plugin

This is a Figma plugin that organizes components visually. It will list all components available on one Figma page and organize it into a frame.

To use it, follow the steps below:

### Install Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/.

### Install Node.js and NPM

You can download Node.js here, which will include NPM: https://nodejs.org/en/download/.

### Install TypeScript

To install TypeScript, run sudo npm install -g typescript in a terminal. (This isn't installed by Visual Studio Code).

### Get the Figma desktop app

Plugin development and testing needs to be done using the Figma desktop app. This is because Figma needs to read your code saved as a local file. The Figma desktop app can be downloaded here: https://www.figma.com/downloads/.

If you already have the desktop app, please make sure to update to the latest version, as several features have been added specifically in order to provide a better plugin development experience.

### Log in to your account and open the file editor in the Figma desktop app

You can open any existing document or create a new one.

### Download this folder

Download it to the location of your choosing.

### Import it into Figma
Go to Menu > Plugins > Development > Import Plugin from Manifest. When prompt, navigate to the Component Organizer folder, and import manifest.json.
